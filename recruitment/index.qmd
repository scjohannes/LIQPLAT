As a wizard and scholar of Middle-earth, I have been studying the magic of the natural world for centuries. Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.

```{r}
time <- seq(as.Date("2024-05-01"), as.Date("2024-12-31"), by = "months")
recruited <- seq(from = 0, to = 70, by = 10)

plot <- ggplot(tibble(time, recruited), aes(x = time, y = recruited)) +
  geom_point(color = "orange") +
  geom_line(color = "orange") + 
  geom_area(alpha = 1/2, fill = "orange")

ggplotly(plot)
```
