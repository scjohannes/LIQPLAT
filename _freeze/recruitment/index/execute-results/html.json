Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![](gandalf_image_1.jpg)\n\n![](gandalf_image_2.jpg)\n\n![](gandalf_image_3.jpg)\n\n![](gandalf_image_4.jpg)\n:::\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div  style=\"margin: 30px; text-align: center;\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/\" role=\"button\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"padding: 15px 30px;\">View the tutorial for this template (+ download link)</a>\n</div>\n```\n",
